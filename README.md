# codex-in-claude

Call **OpenAI Codex** from **Claude Code** — for an independent second opinion, structured
code review, and delegated coding tasks — through a FastMCP plugin that drives the `codex` CLI
safely.

> The mirror image of [`cc-plugin-codex`](https://github.com/briandconnelly/cc-plugin-codex)
> (which lets Codex call Claude Code). Inspired by `openai/codex-plugin-cc`, rebuilt around
> `codex exec` (not the experimental app-server protocol) for robustness.

> **Status:** alpha. The agent-visible surface is versioned by a `fingerprint`; pre-1.0 minor
> releases may change it.

## Why

A second model is a cheap, high-value check. `codex-in-claude` lets a Claude Code session hand
Codex a question, a diff to review, or a task to implement — and get back a structured,
**safe-by-default** result you stay in control of.

| Tier | Codex sandbox | Where edits go | Use for |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| `consult` | `read-only` | nothing — text/findings only | questions, second opinions |
| `review` | `read-only` | nothing — structured findings | reviewing your git changes |
| `propose` | `workspace-write` (temp git **worktree**) | isolated worktree → returns a **reviewable diff, never auto-applied** | delegating a coding task |

Planned later milestone: an explicit opt-in `apply` tier for live-tree edits. It is not exposed by
the current tool set.

## Requirements

- The [`codex` CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) on `PATH`, authenticated
  (`codex login` — ChatGPT or API key). Tested against `codex-cli 0.140`.
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on `PATH` (Claude Code launches the MCP server with `uvx`).
- Python 3.11+ available to `uvx`.
- `git` (for review and delegate).

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Confirm Codex itself is installed and authenticated.
codex login

# 2. Add the marketplace, then install the plugin in Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add briandconnelly/codex-in-claude
/plugin install codex-in-claude
```

Then run `/codex:status` in Claude Code. It is free (no model call) and checks that the `codex`
CLI is found, authenticated, and within the tested compatibility range.

For a first useful run:

- `/codex:consult is this approach sound?` for a read-only second opinion.
- `/codex:review` to review your current git changes.
- `/codex:delegate add focused tests for this behavior` to get a proposed diff in an isolated
  worktree.

The MCP server is launched on demand via `uvx` from a pinned release tag, so updates are deliberate.

## Tools

**Active (call the model and may spend tokens):**

- `codex_consult(question, …)` — read-only second opinion / answer.
- `codex_review_changes(scope, base, commit, paths, …)` — review `working_tree` / `branch` /
  `commit`; returns structured findings.
- `codex_delegate(task, …)` — implement a task in an isolated worktree; returns a reviewable
  `diff` that is **not** applied.
- `codex_delegate_async(task, …)` — same as `codex_delegate` but detached: returns a `job_id`
  immediately. Starting a job commits to spend (it runs to completion or its deadline).

**Free (local only):**

- `codex_status` — readiness, version, auth, resolved defaults.
- `codex_dry_run(scope, …)` — preview a review's scope/diff size/redactions before spending.
- `codex_delegate_dry_run(task, …)` — preview a delegate's seeded baseline (HEAD commit, plus
  tracked, uncommitted, and untracked counts and size) and prompt size before spending; no worktree
  is created.
- `codex_capabilities` — tool inventory + result fingerprint.
- `codex_job_status(job_id, …)` / `codex_job_result` / `codex_job_consume_result` /
  `codex_job_cancel` / `codex_job_list` — background-job lifecycle. State is disk-backed and
  survives server restarts; jobs are bounded by a wall-clock deadline with TTL + count-cap
  eviction. Honor `poll_after_ms` (it grows with a running job's elapsed runtime, bounded, so you
  back off automatically); don't poll in a tight loop. Results are retained `ttl_seconds` **after**
  a job completes, so `expires_at` is null while it runs and is set once it finishes.

Slash commands wrap these: `/codex:status`, `/codex:consult`, `/codex:review`,
`/codex:delegate`, `/codex:delegate-async`, `/codex:dry-run`.

Active tools send the prompt and relevant context/diffs to OpenAI through the `codex` CLI. Treat
Codex's output as claims to verify, not as instructions to follow blindly.

## Result envelopes

Every tool returns a discriminated envelope keyed by `ok`. The success shape depends on the tool:
all of `codex_consult`/`codex_review_changes`/`codex_delegate` carry `summary`/`findings`/`meta`,
but the review-only `verdict`/`confidence` appear solely on `codex_review_changes` and the proposed
`diff` only on `codex_delegate` — consult (Q&A) carries neither a verdict nor a diff. `codex_status`,
`codex_capabilities`, the `codex_job_*` lifecycle tools, `codex_dry_run`, and `codex_delegate_dry_run`
return their own documented shapes (branch on the tool, or on `ok`/`tool`/`status`, before reading
fields). Failure is uniform: an `error` object built for machine-driven recovery, not just prose:

- `code` — a stable error code from a fixed set (e.g. `unsupported_isolation`, `invalid_scope`,
  `job_running`, `job_not_found`).
- `message` / `repair` — human-readable detail and prose guidance.
- `offending_param` — the parameter at fault, when one applies.
- `retryable` + `retry_after_ms` — whether retrying can succeed and how long to back off first.
- `allowed_values` — the concrete valid values for an enum-like param (e.g. `invalid_scope` lists
  `working_tree`, `branch`, `commit`), so you can repair without parsing prose.
- `repair_tool` + `repair_tool_params` — a tool to call to recover and the args to pass it (e.g.
  `job_running` → `codex_job_status` with `{"job_id": …}`).

`codex_capabilities` lists the error codes each tool may return (`error_codes`) as an advisory guide
— useful for planning recovery, but not a closed contract. The envelope shape is versioned by
`fingerprint`; clients can cache by it.

## Workspace selection

When calling the MCP tools directly, pass `workspace_root` as an absolute path to the repository you
want Codex to inspect or edit. Claude Code usually supplies the current repo as an MCP root for slash
commands; if neither an MCP root nor `workspace_root` is available, the server may fall back to its
own launch directory and return `meta.workspace_warning`.

Review and delegate operations need a git repository. `codex_delegate` also requires at least one
commit so it can create the temporary worktree.

## Safety

- `consult` and `review` are strictly read-only.
- `propose` (the `delegate` tools) lets Codex write, but only inside a throwaway git worktree
  seeded from `HEAD` plus replayable uncommitted tracked changes. Untracked files are not copied.
  Your working tree is never modified by the plugin; you review the returned diff and apply it
  yourself.
- Secret-looking content in gathered diffs is redacted (defense-in-depth, not a guarantee — Codex
  can read files itself during a run; use `isolation` and a clean workspace for sensitive repos).
- The plugin never passes Codex's `--dangerously-bypass-*` flags.

## Configuration (env, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_*`)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MODEL` | unset | Codex model override |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 180 | per-call timeout (clamped 10–600) |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_ISOLATION` | `inherit` | `inherit` \| `ignore-config` \| `ignore-rules` |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES` | 200000 | cap on prompt/diff bytes |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_DELEGATE_DIFF_BYTES` | 200000 | cap on the inline diff a delegate run returns; larger diffs are truncated with `meta.truncated`/`meta.truncation_hint` (min 1000) |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 60 | git command timeout |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_STATE_DIR` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/codex-in-claude/jobs` or `~/.cache/codex-in-claude/jobs` | disk-backed background-job records |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_TTL` | 86400 | seconds a finished job record is kept (min 60) |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_MAX_SECONDS` | 1800 | background-job wall-clock cap (clamped 60–7200) |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_MAX_COUNT` | 50 | retained jobs per workspace (clamped 1–1000) |
| `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` | built-in tested set | comma-separated `codex` `major.minor` versions to treat as supported |

## Troubleshooting

If a tool call fails with a transport error (`Connection closed`, or
`No such tool available: mcp__codex-in-claude__*`), the stdio server is down. Relaunch the
`codex-in-claude` MCP server and confirm readiness with `codex_status` (or `/codex:status`) before
resuming. While it is down you can fall back to the `codex` CLI directly for a read-only consult or
review — `codex exec --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check -` (prompt on stdin) — but this
bypasses the plugin's diff gathering, secret redaction, input-byte bounding, and structured envelope, so
sanitize input yourself and prefer restoring the server. See the `collaborating-with-codex` skill for
the full fallback guidance.

## Local development

```sh
uv sync
uv run pytest                       # unit tests (95% coverage floor)
uv run pytest -m integration --no-cov   # live tests; needs codex installed + logged in
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run ty check
uv run codex-in-claude-mcp          # run the MCP server over stdio
```

To test the plugin from a local checkout, point `.mcp.json` at
`uv run --project /path/to/codex-in-claude codex-in-claude-mcp` instead of the pinned `uvx` tag.
